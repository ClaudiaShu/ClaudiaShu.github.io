I am now a second year Ph.D. student based at the [Centre for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/) (AI) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) (UCL), supervised by [Dr Vasileios Lampos](https://lampos.net/home). I finished my Master of Research degree (Hamlyn Prize) at the Hamlyn Centre/Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, supervised by [Dr Benny Lo](https://www.bennyplo.com/bennylo/index.php). I obtained BSc degree (Honor Student) in Remote Sensing Science and Technology from Wuhan University in 2021. My research interests focus on Artificial Intelligence for healthcare. 
<!-- I am especially interested in using machine learning models to understand health-related statements and better facilitate them to downstream tasks. -->
